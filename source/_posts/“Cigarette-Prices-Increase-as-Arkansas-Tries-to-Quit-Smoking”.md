#  “Cigarette Prices Increase as Arkansas Tries to Quit Smoking”

Arkansas is one of the latest states to increase its cigarette prices in an effort to curb smoking. The state’s price for a pack of cigarettes increased from $5.25 to $6.50 this month.

The increase is part of a larger effort by the state to reduce its smoking rate, which is currently at 24%. Arkansas hopes that the increase will prompt smokers to quit, or at least smoke less.

This is not the first time that Arkansas has raised its cigarette prices. In fact, the state has been increasing its prices regularly for the past few years. In 2017, the price for a pack of cigarettes increased from $5 to $5.25.

Other states have also been increasing their cigarette prices in an attempt to reduce smoking rates. In California, for example, the price for a pack of cigarettes increased from $8.75 to $9.65 in July.

Smoking is a major public health issue in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), smoking causes more than 480,000 deaths each year in the United States. This equates to about one out of every five deaths.

Smoking also costs the United States billions of dollars each year in medical expenses and lost productivity. The CDC estimates that it costs the country more than $300 billion annually in direct and indirect costs related to smoking.

Reducing smoking rates is therefore critical to improving public health and reducing healthcare costs in the United States. Raising cigarette prices is one way of doing this, and it appears to be working, as smoking rates have been declining nationwide in recent years.

#  “Arkansas Smoking Rates Drop After Casino Cigarette Ban”

In a new study released by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS), it was found that the amount of people in Arkansas who smoke cigarettes has decreased since a casino opened in neighboring Oklahoma that banned smoking inside.

The study, which is set to be published in an upcoming issue of the journal Tobacco Control, surveyed over 1,700 Arkansas residents before and after the opening of the Choctaw Casino & Resort in Durant, Oklahoma. It found that the percentage of smokers in Arkansas dropped from 27.5% to 23.8% after the casino opened.

“This is one of the first studies to show a relationship between opening a casino and reducing smoking rates,” said UAMS epidemiologist Dr. Mark Smith, the lead author of the study. “It suggests that smoke-free policies at casinos may help reduce smoking rates among adults int he surrounding community.”

Critics of casino gambling often argue that it contributes to increased levels of problem gambling and can have harmful consequences on the local economy. However, this new study provides evidence that casino gambling can also have public health benefits by helping reduce smoking rates.

#  “Cigarette Sales Up in Arkansas After Casino Ban”

Arkansas has been facing a cigarette sales increase after the state’s casino ban went into effect in October of last year. The Arkansas Alcoholic Beverage Control Board reported a 3 percent increase in cigarette sales statewide from the previous year.

While it is unclear exactly why the sales have increased, some believe that people are turning to cigarettes as an alternative to gambling. “It’s certainly a plausible explanation,” said ABC board director Adrienne Johnson.

Others believe that the increase is due to the fact that cigarettes are now more expensive than ever before, as the state has raised taxes on tobacco products multiple times in recent years. In 2017, Arkansas became the state with the highest cigarette tax in the country when it increased its tax from $1.15 to $2.50 per pack.

Whatever the reason for the increase, lawmakers are concerned about the negative effects that cigarettes can have on public health. Smoking is responsible for more than 480,000 deaths each year in the United States, and it is one of the leading causes of preventable death.

Smoking also costs taxpayers billions of dollars each year due to healthcare expenses and lost productivity. Lawmakers in Arkansas are now considering whether or not they should raise taxes on cigarettes even further in an effort to reduce smoking rates and improve public health.

#  “Tualip Casino Sells More Cigarettes Than Any Other Store in Arkansas”

A recent study by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids revealed that the Tualip Casino in Quapaw, Oklahoma sells more cigarettes than any other store in Arkansas. The casino is located just across the border from Jay, Arkansas, and is easily accessible to smokers in the state.

The study found that the Tualip Casino sold nearly $3 million worth of cigarettes in 2017. That’s almost twice as much as the second-place store, which is a truck stop in Fort Smith, Arkansas.

The fact that a Native American-owned casino is selling so many cigarettes is especially troubling because tribal casinos are supposed to be exempt from state and local tobacco ordinances. The Tualip Casino should be using its influence to reduce smoking, not promote it.

Smoking is a major public health issue in Arkansas. The state has one of the highest rates of adult smoking in the country, and it’s also home to some of the nation’s worst air quality.

Tobacco use is responsible for nearly 6,000 deaths in Arkansas each year, and it costs the state more than $2 billion annually in health care expenses.

It’s time for the Tualip Casino to do its part to address this epidemic and stop selling so many cigarettes.

#  “Smoking Rates Dropped in Arkansas After Tualip Casino Cigarette Ban”

A new study from the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) has found that smoking rates dropped significantly in Tualip, Arkansas after the tribal casino outlawed cigarettes in 2012. The study, which is published in the American Journal of Public Health, surveyed over 1,200 people and found that the percentage of smokers dropped by more than half – from 34 percent to 16 percent – in the three years following the casino’s ban.

Lead author Dr. Holly Hedegaard said that “these findings suggest that comprehensive smoke-free policies can help reduce smoking prevalence and protect nonsmokers from secondhand smoke exposure.” She added that policymakers should consider implementing similar bans in other areas, such as restaurants and bars.

In a statement, Tualip Chairman Michael Harris said that the tribe was “very proud” of its smoke-free policy and called it a “major contributor to improved public health and quality of life” for its members. He added that the tribe was committed to “continuing our efforts to create healthier environments for our people.”

The study’s authors say that their findings could have implications for other tribal communities across the country. There are currently about 200 tribal casinos in operation in the US, most of which allow smoking indoors.
