#  Slot Machine Maker Plans to Hit Namibia

Las Vegas-based slot machine maker International Game Technology PLC said it plans to start supplying its products to casinos in Namibia next year, becoming the latest international player to enter the southern African country’s gambling market.

The company said it had signed a deal with local gaming and entertainment company Casinos de Namibia to supply its machines to 12 of that country’s casinos from 2019.

IGT didn’t disclose how much it was investing in the venture but said it would create jobs in Namibia. It also said it hoped to capture a portion of the $1 billion in annual gaming revenue generated in Africa by 2020.

IGT is the second major international slot machine supplier to announce plans to enter the Namibian market this year after Swedish company NetEnt AB said in May that it had struck a deal with South African casino operator Sun International Ltd. to supply its products to its casinos there.

The moves come as Africa’s gambling sector grows, helped by increasing wealth and rising numbers of middle-class consumers. The continent is home to 1.2 billion people, about 40% of whom are below the age of 18, IGT said, citing research firm New World Wealth.

Africa’s gambling market was worth an estimated $14.5 billion in 2017 and is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 10.5% over the next decade, according to New World Wealth.



Namibia is one of Africa's fastest-growing economies, with a GDP growth rate averaging around 5% over the past few years, thanks to mining and fisheries exports, among others sectors. IGT's move into the country provides an interesting case study for how slot machine manufacturers assess market potential outside of their home markets - notably within countries that have growing economies and/or populations
