#  How to Avoid Internet Gambling Addiction 

Internet gambling addiction has become a serious issue in many parts of the world. If you are one of the people who are at risk of developing this type of addiction, then it is important to take steps to avoid it.

The first step is to be aware of the warning signs that you may be addicted to internet gambling. Some of the most common symptoms include:

- Feeling like you have to gamble online
- Losing control over your gambling habits
- Becoming restless or irritable when you can't gamble online
- Gambling more money than you can afford to lose

If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, it is important to talk to a doctor or counsellor right away. They can help you get treatment for your addiction and prevent it from becoming worse.

Another step you can take to avoid internet gambling addiction is to set rules for yourself and stick to them. For example, decide how much money you are allowed to spend on gambling each month and don't exceed that limit. You should also make sure that you are not using borrowed money to gamble with. If you do start borrowing money in order to fund your gambling habit, this is a sign that your addiction has become out of control.

Finally, try to stay away from websites or apps that allow you to gamble online. This includes sites like PokerStars, 888poker, and William Hill Casino. There are many other types of websites and apps that don't involve gambling, so try sticking to those instead.

#  Five Ways to Stop Betting on Sports Online 

Are you one of those people who can’t seem to stop betting on sports, even when you know it’s not a good idea? If so, you’re not alone. In fact, many people find it difficult to resist the urge to bet on sports, especially when they have money on the line.

4. Remove financial incentive

If one of the reasons why you continue betting on sports is because there’s money on the line, consider removing this incentive altogether. This could mean either cashing out your winnings as soon as they come in or setting up a bank account specifically for your gambling funds.

5. Get professional help

If all else fails, consider seeking professional help. This could mean talking with a therapist or joining a support group specifically for people with gambling problems
