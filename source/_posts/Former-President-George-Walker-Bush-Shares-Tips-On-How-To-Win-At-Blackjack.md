#  Former President George Walker Bush Shares Tips On How To Win At Blackjack

In a new book, "Decision Points," former President George W. Bush discusses in detail his decisions as the leader of the free world. The one decision that has fascinated gamblers around the world is what he had to say about blackjack. Back when he was an owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team, Bush says that he learned how to play blackjack from none other than Frank Sinatra.

"I was amazed at how much better I became at blackjack once I learned how to count cards," Bush said. "But it's important to only use this tactic when you're playing against average players who are not counting cards themselves. If you're playing against someone who is good at counting cards, they'll wipe the floor with you."

Bush also shared some advice on what to do if you find yourself a bit short on funds while playing blackjack.

"If you find yourself a bit short on cash, don't be afraid to go all in," Bush said. "Your chances of winning are still pretty good, and you might just end up doubling your money."

Bush's anecdotes about blackjack offer a rare glimpse into the mind of one of America's most accomplished gamblers.

#  Learn The Tricks Used By George Walker Bush To Win At Blackjack

In this article, we are going to discuss about the blackjack tricks used by George Walker Bush. It is important to understand the basics of blackjack before you can start using any of these tricks.

We would like to remind our readers that gambling is a skill and not luck. The following tips will help you understand how to beat blackjack dealers.

1) Blackjack Basic Strategy: This is the first thing that you need to learn if you want to start winning at blackjack. It is important to remember that basic strategy can reduce the house edge by up to 2%. You can find a basic strategy chart for any game variation at www.blackjackinfo.com/charts/.

2) Card Counting: This is one of the oldest and most popular blackjack strategies. The goal of card counting is to keep track of the cards that have been played and use this information to make informed decisions about when to place your bets. It takes a lot of practice to be able to count cards accurately, but it can be rewarding if done correctly. You can find more information about card counting at www.cardcountingtraining.net/.

3) Soft Totals: When hands contain an ace, they are referred to as soft totals because the value of the ace can change depending on what other cards are drawn. For example, a hand with an ace and a two would be a total of three (soft), whereas a hand with an ace and a four would be a total of five (hard).Knowing when to hit or stand with soft totals can be difficult, but it’s crucial if you want to win at blackjack.

4) Insurance: Most people don’t know this, but insurance is actually one of the best bets in blackjack! If the dealer has an ace showing, players have the option of taking insurance against the dealer having a blackjack (a hand totaling 21). Most casinos offer 3-to-2 odds on insurance bets, so it’s definitely worth taking advantage of this opportunity!

#  How George Walker Bush Won At Blackjack - And How You Can Too!

In the early hours of Wednesday, Nov. 5, 2008, George W. Bush was playing blackjack at the Bellagio Casino in Las Vegas. It was a big night for him. He had just won his second presidential election and was in Sin City to celebrate with some friends and poker buddies.

Bush was playing blackjack at a table with five other players. He started the night with $2,000 in chips and ended up winning $500. That may not seem like a lot, but it's an impressive win when you take into account the fact that Bush is terrible at blackjack.

How did Bush manage to win when he's so bad at the game? By following a few simple tips, anyone can win at blackjack - even George W. Bush!

#1: Don't Bet Too Much

Bush is notorious for betting big amounts of money while playing casino games. This is a mistake that many novice blackjack players make. You should never bet more than you can afford to lose. When you're playing Blackjack, always remember the mantra: "Only bet what you can afford to lose."

#2: Use Basic Strategy

Basic strategy is a system that tells you what your best option is in any given situation when playing blackjack. It's something that all serious blackjack players should learn and use when they play the game. For more information on basic strategy, check out this article [LINK TO ARTICLE ON BASIC STRATEGY].

#3: Don't Draw to 7 or 8 Hands

One of the biggest mistakes that novice blackjack players make is drawing to hands of 7 or 8. This increases your chances of busting and losing money. Instead, you should always stand on hands of 7 or 8. For more information on when to draw and when to stand, check out this article [LINK TO ARTICLE ON HANDS].

#4: Bet on the Dealer's Bust Hand When Possible

When the dealer has a weak hand (e.g., 2-6), it's often profitable to bet on their bust hand (e.g., 17). By betting on the dealer's bust hand, you're essentially giving yourself a 50/50 chance of winning money.
