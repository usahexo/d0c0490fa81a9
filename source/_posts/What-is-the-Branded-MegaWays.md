# What are the games on the Branded MegaWays?

Just a few years ago, playing slots online was something that was only done in land-based casinos. Sure, there were some online casinos out there, but they were nothing like the ones we have today. They were restricted to just a few games and didn't have many of the features that we take for granted now.

Fast forward to today and things have changed dramatically. Online casinos are now home to hundreds (if not thousands) of different games, including all of the popular slots that you would find in any traditional casino. And because there is so much competition among online casinos, they are always looking for new ways to attract players and keep them coming back for more.

This has led to the rise of a new type of slot game called MegaWays. MegaWays games are essentially just like regular slots games, but with one major difference - they use a MegaWays engine instead of a traditional reel engine. This gives players the opportunity to win payouts on multiple lines simultaneously, which can result in some pretty big payouts.

Some of the most popular MegaWays games include titles such as Lightning Gems, Big Thunder King, Fortunes Of Sparta, and Starburst. All of these games are available at CasinoCoin Casino, where you can test them out for free before playing for real money. So if you're looking for some new and exciting slots action, be sure to check out the Branded MegaWays games at CasinoCoin Casino!
