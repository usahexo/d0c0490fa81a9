#  Nevada, Delaware look to legalize online gambling in 2017

Both Nevada and Delaware legislatures are considering measures to legalize various forms of online gambling in 2017.

Delaware has been studying the impact of legalizing online poker since 2014 and is now ready to take the plunge, with a bill expected to be proposed in early 2017.

Nevada's move is in response to a recent decision by the U.S. Department of Justice to reverse a 2011 policy which had effectively legalized online gambling.

The new policy allows states to legalize online gambling as long as it is restricted to people within the state boundaries.

This change will allow Nevada's larger casinos, who have been pushing for legalization, to offer their games online.

Other states are also likely to follow suit, as the potential revenue from online gambling is seen as a major boon for cash-strapped state governments.

#  NJ considering online gambling bill in early 2017

A new bill proposing the legalization of online gambling in New Jersey is making its way through the state legislature in early 2017. The proposed bill, S-490, was introduced by Senator Jim Whelan on February 2 and would allow Atlantic City casinos to offer online gambling.

The bill has already been met with resistance from some lawmakers and gaming officials who are concerned about the impact it could have on the state's casino industry. However, supporters of the bill argue that it would be a major boost to Atlantic City's struggling casino industry, which has seen a decline in revenue in recent years.

Under the proposed bill, only licensed casinos in Atlantic City would be allowed to offer online gambling services. The bill also includes a number of safeguards to help protect consumers, including requirements that players be at least 21 years old and that casinos verify players' identities.

The proposed bill comes as states around the country are weighing whether to legalize online gambling. In December 2016, Pennsylvania became the fourth state to legalize online gambling when Governor Tom Wolf signed into law a measure authorizing slot machines, table games and poker games to be played online.

If passed, New Jersey's proposed bill would make it one of the most liberal states in terms of online gambling. Nevada, Delaware and New Jersey are currently the only three states where residents can legally gamble online.

#  California could legalize online gambling this year

Californians could be able to gamble online as soon as this year, if a new bill is passed by the state legislature.

AB 2863, introduced by Assemblyman Reggie Jones-Sawyer in February, would legalize and regulate online gambling in California. The bill has been referred to the Committee on Governmental Organization, where it awaits further action.

If the bill is passed, Californians would be able to gamble online at licensed and regulated websites. The websites would be subject to strict regulations, including age restrictions and bans on certain types of games.

Jones-Sawyer says that his bill would bring much-needed revenue to the state government, while also protecting consumers from unscrupulous operators.

"This is a viable industry that can generate significant revenue for California," he said in a statement. "We must ensure that our regulations are robust and protect consumers while allowing this new industry to grow."

Online gambling is already legal in a number of states, including New Jersey, Nevada and Delaware. However, California's proposed bill would be much broader than these existing laws, legalizing a range of different types of gambling activities.

#  Pennsylvania mulls legalizing online gambling in 2017

Pennsylvania is among the states that are currently considering the legalization of online gambling in 2017. The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board has already drafted rules that would allow casinos in the state to offer online poker, slot machines and other casino games to people within the borders of the state.

The proposed rules were released in February, and there is a 45-day public comment period that is currently underway. There is no set date for when the board will vote on the proposal, but it's likely that a decision will be made within the next few months.

If the proposal is approved, Pennsylvania will become the fourth state in the US to legalize online gambling. Delaware, New Jersey and Nevada have all previously legalized online gambling, and each of those states has seen a boost in revenue from the activity.

There is some opposition to the proposal in Pennsylvania, as there always is with any change to gambling laws. However, it's likely that the majority of lawmakers in the state are in favor of legalizing online gambling, given that it could bring in millions of dollars in revenue each year.

The proposed rules would allow casinos in Pennsylvania to offer online poker, slot machines and other casino games to people within the borders of the state.

#  Michigan may consider online gambling legislation in 2017

Michigan Legislators are again considering legalizing some forms of online gambling, after a similar bill failed to pass last year.

The new proposal would allow licensed casinos in the state to offer online poker, blackjack, and other casino games to residents. The bill would also mandate that the Michigan Gaming Control Board create and enforce regulations for the new industry.

Players would have to be physically located in Michigan in order to participate in the games, and the legislation would prohibit anyone under 21 from playing.

Michigan is one of a handful of states that has yet to legalize any form of online gambling. But with several states already offering online gambling, and several more expected to do so in 2017, Michigan lawmakers may feel pressure to act.

 Supporters of online gambling argue that it could help boost the state's economy, as well as provide more entertainment options for residents. They note that other forms of gambling are already popular in Michigan, and that regulating and taxing online gambling would bring in additional revenue for the state.

Opponents argue that online gambling can be addictive and lead to social problems. They also say that it could be difficult to enforce age restrictions and other regulations on an internet-based industry.
