#  Potawatomi Bingo Open in Mongolia This Weekend!

The Potawatomi Bingo Casino in Milwaukee, Wisconsin will open a new casino this weekend in the city of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.

This is the first casino to be operated by the Potawatomi Nation outside of Wisconsin. The casino will feature traditional bingo and slot machines, as well as a restaurant and bar.

The opening of the casino is seen as a major step forward for the Potawatomi Nation, which has been looking to expand its operations for some time. Officials hope that the new casino will help to create jobs and bring additional revenue to the tribe.

The Potawatomi Nation is one of the largest Native American tribes in the United States, with more than 20,000 members. The tribe has been operating casinos since the early 1990s, and currently operates eleven casinos across Wisconsin.
