#  Exactly What Hands To Play - Poker Vavada style!

The next step in poker strategy, once you have learned the different hands to play, is understanding which hands to play and when. Just like in any other game, in poker there are optimal times to make different moves in order to win the most money. The goal of this article is to help players understand when to raise, call, or fold by teaching them which hands fall into each category.

We will start by discussing the absolute strongest hands a player can have in Texas Hold’em – these are known as “premium hands.” Premium hands are made up of aces and kings (A-K), queens and jacks (Q-J), and pairs of 10s or better. These hands should almost always be raised preflop as they offer a large amount of potential for winning big pots.

Next, we will move on to the next category of hands – strong hands. Strong hands consist of any two cards that are not premium, such as A-2 or K-Q. Players should typically raise with these hands preflop if there are between 2-4 other players dealt in, as the odds of making a strong hand are good and there is potential for gaining information on how the other players at the table are playing.

After strong hands come medium strength hands, which include any two cards that are not among the strongest possible combinations. These would be Hands like Q-7 or J-8. In general, these types of hands should only be played when there is no risk involved and/or when there is an opportunity to bluff.

Finally, we have Weak Hands – those that should generally only be played when there is no alternative. These types of Hands usually consist of two high cards that are not suited (e.g., 2-7). When playing weak hands it is important to remember that they often have negative expected value (EV) and should only be used if the player feels they can outplay their opponents postflop.

Knowing which type of hand to play at any given point during a poker game can be critical for achieving success. By following the guidelines above, players can begin to develop a basic understanding for WHEN TO RAISE PREFLOP, WHEN TO CALL PREFLOP and WHEN TO FOLD PREFLOP when playing Texas Hold’em Poker!

#  Play Money Poker - What hands should you play?

There are so many different poker hands that you can be playing, it can be tough to know which ones to focus on. In this article, we're going to take a look at the Play Money poker hands that you should be playing, and give you some tips on how to play them.

One of the most important things to remember when playing poker is that you need to have a good mix of hands. You don't want to be playing all low cards, or all high cards - you need to have a range of hands that will allow you to make both strong and weak hands.

The Play Money Poker hands that we're going to focus on today are:

Ace-King Suited
Ace-Queen Suited
King-Queen Suited
Ace-Ten Suited
Two Pair (higher ranking pairs first)
Pair of Aces
Pair of Kings
etc.

  So, what do these hands mean? Well, let's start with the easiest one - Ace-King suited. This hand is made up of two high cards - an Ace and a King - and is suited, meaning that the two cards are both of the same suit. This hand is quite strong, as it has two chances of making a flush or a straight. 
Ace-Queen suited is also quite strong, as it has two chances for a flush or straight. However, it's not as strong as Ace-King suited as it doesn't have as many chances for a good hand. 
King-Queen suited is another strong hand, as it has three chances for a flush or straight. However, like Ace-Queen suited, it's not quite as strong as Ace-King suited. 

  Next up are the unsuited hands - Ace-Ten suited and Two Pair. Ace-Ten suited is made up of two high cards and one low card - an Ace and a Ten - and is suited. This hand isn't as strong as the other Play Money Poker hands, but it still has some potential if the right cards come up. Two Pair is made up of two pairs of different ranks - for example, two Queens or two Jacks. This hand isn't quite as strong as Three of a Kind or Full House, but it can still win you some pots if played correctly.   Finally, we have the strongest Play Money Poker hand - Pair of Aces. As the name suggests, this hand contains two Aces. This hand is very strong and is almost always worth betting or raising with.


#  How To Play Poker - Money or no money!

Playing poker for money or for no money is a great way to enjoy the game. Poker is an extremely popular card game that can be played for any stakes, from pennies to hundreds or even thousands of dollars. The object of the game is to win money by betting on the value of your cards relative to those of your opponents.

No matter what the stakes, the basic rules of poker remain the same: make correct decisions about when to bet, raise, and fold; and never reveal your cards to anyone except the dealer.

When playing poker for money, it's important to remember that there is a real risk involved. Players can lose not just their buy-in, but also their entire stake if they make poor decisions or run into a hot player. It's therefore important to maintain a cool head and only bet what you can afford to lose.

If you're just starting out in poker, it's best to play for no money until you're comfortable with the basics of the game. This will help you avoid making costly mistakes and improve your chances of winning some money once you start playing for real stakes. There are plenty of opportunities to play poker online and in land-based casinos for free, so there's no need to risk your hard-earned cash until you're ready.

Whether you're playing for fun or for profit, always remember that poker is a gamble and that Lady Luck can smile on anyone at any time. Keep practicing and learning as much as you can about the game, and eventually you may find yourself raking in big pots!

#  Win At Poker - Playing for play money!

\A big decision for any poker player is whether to play for money or for play money. Money games can be more exciting and profitable, but there is always the risk of losing money. Play money games are less risky, but they can also be less exciting. The following is a guide to help you decide if you should play for money or for play money.

One reason to play for play money is if you are not sure whether you are a winning player or not. Play money games give you the opportunity to make mistakes without risking any real money. If you are a winning player, playing for play money will help you to improve your skills by giving you more experience against better competition.

If you are not a winning player, playing for play money can help you to become a winning player. You can learn which hands to play, how to bet, and how to respond to different situations by playing for play money. Playing for real money can be very costly if you are making mistakes.

Another reason to play for play money is if you want to improve your bankroll. A bankroll is the amount of cash that a player has available to them in order to continue playing poker. Playing for real money can quickly deplete your bankroll, especially if you are a beginner or are playing in high-stakes games. Playing for play money will allow you to build your bankroll slowly so that when you do start playing for real money, you will have more chips available to you.

There are several drawbacks to playing for play money instead of real money. The first drawback is that the stakes tend to be much lower in play money games than in real money games. This means that the pots tend not be as large and the profits tend not be as large. Another drawback is that it can be more difficult to win in a online casino when playing with fake chips than with real ones. Finally, some people find that playing for paymoney makes the game more exciting than playing for free chips
