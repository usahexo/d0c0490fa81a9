#  John Updike Writes About the Black Numbers on a Roulette Wheel 

John Updike, the Pulitzer Prize-winning American writer, observed the black numbers on a roulette wheel at a casino in Las Vegas and remarked on their ubiquity and predictability. In his short essay "A Game of Roulette" (1964), Updike ponders the meaning and fascination of the black numbers and speculates on their role in human lives.

Updike begins by noting that the black numbers are "mathematically insignificant" and yet they hold a special allure for many people. He observes that the black numbers are neither good nor bad, but simply "there," much like life itself. Updike suggests that the black numbers remind us of our mortality and our insignificance in the grand scheme of things. Yet despite their dark connotations, the black numbers also fascinate us with their promise of random chance and potential luck.

Updike muses on the psychology of roulette players and observes that many gamblers are drawn to the game by its aura of mystery and risk. He notes that while most people can't predict which number will come up next on a roulette wheel, they still find hope in the possibility of lucky number gambling. Updike comments on the human desire for certainty in an uncertain world, and he observes that casinos offer a brief escape from reality into a world of make-believe.

In conclusion, Updike reflects on the appeal of gambling and its power to seduce people into throwing away their money. He remarks that while some people gamble for fun, others do it out of desperation or neediness. Ultimately, Updike sees gambling as a form of self-destruction that can lead to bankruptcy, broken families, and even suicide. The allure of the black numbers is strong indeed, but it comes with a high price tag.

#  John Updike Draws Inspiration from the Black Numbers on a Roulette Wheel 

John Updike once said, "For me, the fictions have been a way of staying alive, of getting interested in life again." This may be true for many writers, but for Updike, it was especially poignant. As a young man, he was diagnosed with leukemia and given a less than 40% chance of survival. It was during his long hospital stay that he began to write short stories as a form of escape from his bleak reality.

Ironically, it was the roulette wheel at the casino that served as one of his sources of inspiration. He was fascinated by the black numbers on the wheel and their potential to create order in what seemed to be a chaotic world. In an interview with The Paris Review, he said:

"The black numbers on the roulette wheel are so beautiful, so inevitable. It's like seeing the hand of God at work. I'm always happy when I see black come up."

This fascination with order and chance is evident in much of Updike's work. He often explores the tension between determinism and free will, illustrating how our lives are shaped both by fate and our own choices.

One of his most famous novels, Rabbit Angstrom, is set against the backdrop of America's declining manufacturing industry. Rabbit is a character who feels trapped by his circumstances, but ultimately fails to escape them due to his own stubbornness and lack of imagination. Updike once said of Rabbit:

"He is condemned to live out his life within the narrow confines of his own self-deceptions."

Updike's novels are filled with characters who are all struggling against their own limitations. And yet, even in their failures, there is something admirable about their determination to keep going in the face of overwhelming odds. Updike himself was no stranger to adversity; he battled cancer not once but twice in his lifetime. But it was this same sense of resilience that allowed him to continue writing until his death in 2009.


 Updike's writing has been praised for its honesty and insightfulness into human nature. His prose is poetic yet accessible, and he has been called "one of the great American writers of our time." In a world that can often seem dark and unpredictable, Updike's work offers a glimmer of hope â€“- a reminder that even in times of turmoil, beauty can still be found in the ordinary moments of life.

#  An Analysis of the Black Numbers on a Roulette Wheel by John Updike 

The black numbers on a roulette wheel are, as their name suggests, black. They comprise the second and sixth through thirty-fourth slots on the wheel, and betting on them is less risky than betting on red, but more risky than betting on green. 

The black numbers are so called because, historically, that's what they were: black. In early roulette wheels, the slots were painted different colors - red, black, green - and players would bet on which color the ball would end up in. But because red came up more often than any other color, players eventually started betting on red as well to make things a bit more interesting. The black numbers have stuck around ever since, even though they're now less likely to come up than either red or green. 

There's no real rhyme or reason to why some numbers are black and some are not; it's just one of those quirky things about roulette that makes the game all the more fascinating. So if you're feeling lucky next time you're at the casino, don't be afraid to give the black numbers a try!
