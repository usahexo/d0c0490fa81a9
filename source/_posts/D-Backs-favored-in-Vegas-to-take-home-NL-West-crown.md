#  D-Backs favored in Vegas to take home NL West crown

The Arizona Diamondbacks are favored to win the NL West this season, according to the odds makers in Las Vegas.

The Diamondbacks have come on strong in recent years, making the playoffs in 2016 and 2017. They return most of their key players from last year's squad, including sluggers Paul Goldschmidt and Jake Lamb.

They will be challenged by the Colorado Rockies, who made a late push last year to win the division. The Los Angeles Dodgers are always a threat, as are the San Diego Padres. But the Diamondbacks appear to be the team to beat in the NL West this year.

#  Zack Greinke among top favorites to win NL Cy Young

Zack Greinke is coming into the 2019 season as one of the top favorites to win the NL Cy Young award. He’s been one of the most consistent pitchers in baseball over the past few seasons, and there’s no indication that he’ll slow down this year.

Greinke had a 3.21 ERA last season, and he has a career ERA of 3.35. He also has a fastball that averages 94 mph, which makes him a tough pitcher to hit. He’s able to locate his fastball well and consistently throws it for strikes.

In addition to his fastball, Greinke also has a devastating slider that he can use to get hitters out. His slider averaged 87 mph last season, and it’s one of the best pitches in baseball. He was able to get hitters out with his slider last season, and there’s no reason to believe that he won’t be able to do so again this year.

Other players who are contenders for the NL Cy Young award include Max Scherzer and Jacob deGrom. Scherzer is coming off another great season, and he should be able to compete for the award again this year. DeGrom had an outstanding 2018 season, but it will be tough for him to replicate those numbers this year.

All three of these pitchers are among the best in baseball, and it should be an interesting race for the NL Cy Young award this year.

#  Diamondbacks have sixth-highest odds to win World Series

Arizona Diamondbacks have the sixth-highest odds to win the World Series, according to a recently released report by [website name].

The National League West Division champions are scheduled to open their title defense on March 28 against the Colorado Rockies at Chase Field.

According to the report, the Boston Red Sox have the best odds to win the World Series (8-1), followed by the Los Angeles Dodgers (9-2), Houston Astros (5-1), New York Yankees (6-1) and Cleveland Indians (8-1).

The Chicago Cubs are listed with the 13th-best odds (16-1) and the Milwaukee Brewers are 24th out of 30 teams with 150-1 odds.

The Diamondbacks’ odds improved from 25-1 after they first reached the playoffs last year.

#  Over $1 million bet on Arizona to win NL pennant

The Arizona Diamondbacks are currently heavy favorites to win the National League pennant this year, with odds at -140 at some sportsbooks. This means that a gambler would have to put down $140 on the Diamondbacks in order to win $100.

This isn't too surprising, as the Diamondbacks were one of the best teams in baseball last year and only got better this offseason with the addition of slugger Paul Goldschmidt.

However, some people are betting much more than just $100 on the D'Backs. A sportsbook in Las Vegas is taking a bet for over $1 million on Arizona to win the NL pennant.

It's unclear who is making this bet, but it will certainly be interesting to see if they can pull off an upset and bring home a championship for Arizona.

#  Bettors bullish on Arizona Diamondbacks in 2017

The Arizona Diamondbacks surprised many in the baseball world last season by not only making the playoffs, but also winning their division. While they were ultimately eliminated in the first round, the D-backs proved that they are a team to be reckoned with in 2017.

Most sportsbooks are bullish on Arizona’s chances this year and have them pegged as one of the top contenders to win the World Series. Bovada has them at +800 to win it all, while BetOnline has them at +900.

Of course, with any team there are a few key players that need to have strong seasons for them to be successful. Paul Goldschmidt is one of those players for Arizona. The All-Star first baseman had another solid season in 2016, hitting .297 with 24 home runs and 95 RBIs. He will need to continue that production if they want to make a deep playoff run.

The Diamondbacks also have a pair of young pitchers who could make a big impact this season. Zack Greinke is coming off a Cy Young Award-winning season and is expected to anchor their rotation. Shelby Miller, who was acquired from Atlanta in an offseason trade, will also be looked upon to provide some stability in the starting rotation.

Arizona made some other interesting moves this offseason, including signing free agent outfielder JD Martinez to a five-year deal. Martinez hit .304 with 22 homers and 68 RBIs last season for Detroit and is expected to provide some big power numbers in the middle of the Diamondbacks lineup.

Overall, there is plenty of reason for optimism in Arizona heading into 2017. They have a solid nucleus of players led by Goldschmidt, and should be able to compete with anyone in the National League. With prices as favorable as they are right now at sportsbooks, there’s no reason not to bet on them making a deep playoff run this year.
