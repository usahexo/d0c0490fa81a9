#  How to Host a New Poker Night: The Ultimate Guide

Hosting a poker night is a great way to get together with your friends and have some fun. But before you can host your own poker night, there are a few things you need to know. This guide will teach you everything you need to know about hosting a poker night, from picking the right location to dealing the cards.

# Choosing the Right Location

One of the most important decisions you'll make when hosting a poker night is choosing the right location. The best location will be spacious enough to accommodate all of your guests, and it should also be relatively quiet so that everyone can focus on the game. If possible, try to find a location with a pool table or other entertainment options so that guests can enjoy themselves even when they're not playing poker.

# Setting Up the Game

Once you've picked a location, it's time to set up the game. The first step is to create a list of players and determine who will be sitting where. You'll also need to decide on a dealer and make sure everyone knows the rules of poker. If this is your first time hosting a poker night, it might be helpful to print out a copy of the rules for everyone to review.

# Dealing the Cards
Cards are an essential part of any poker game, so it's important to know how to deal them properly. The most common way to deal cards is called "strip deals." In strip deals, each player is dealt one card at a time until everyone has five cards. After everyone has their five cards, the next card is placed in the middle of the table (this is called the "burn card") and players take turns drawing one card from either the deck or from their opponent's hand. When playing with more than two players, it's also important to keep track of who's been eliminated by using chips or other markers.

#  How to Host the Perfect Poker Night (Even If You're a Novice)

Poker night is a great way to get together with friends and family, enjoy some snacks and drinks, and take part in some friendly competition. But if you're new to hosting poker nights, it can be tricky to know where to start.

Not to worry - we're here to help! This guide will show you how to host the perfect poker night, even if you're a novice.

First things first: set some ground rules.

It's important that everyone playing knows the ground rules before the game starts, so there are no surprises during play. Here are a few things you'll want to cover:

- The stakes of the game - What kind of chips will be used? Are they worth real money, or are they just for fun?
- How many chips each player will start with - This will help prevent any disputes about who has how many chips later on.
- The order of play - Who goes first, second, etc? 
- Penalties for rule violations - What happens if someone breaks a rule?

Next, determine the type of poker game you'll be playing. There are several different variants of poker - Texas Hold'em, Omaha Hi-Low, Stud Poker, etc. - so pick one that everyone is familiar with.

If you're not sure which variant to choose, check out this helpful guide: [Which Poker Game Should You Play?] (https://www.pokernewsdaily.com/which-poker-game-should-you-play/)
Once you've picked a game, create a seating chart and decide on a dealer. The dealer is responsible for dealing cards and keeping track of the action, so it's important to pick someone who's comfortable with doing both.

Next, it's time to stock up on supplies! Here's what you'll need:
- Poker chips (or coins) 
- A deck of cards 
- A table or folding table 
- Chips and drinks for players 
- Snacks (optional) 
- Poker timer (optional) 

Now that you have everything you need, it's time to set up the table. First, place the table in the middle of the room and set up chairs around it so everyone has a seat. Then, divide the chips equally among all players and place them in front of each player. Finally, shuffle the cards and deal one face down card to each player followed by one face up card (the flop).

The dealer should then begin dealing cards clockwise one at a time until all players have five cards each (a hand). At this point, players can begin betting. The winner is the player with the best hand after all bets have been placed (the showdown).

If you want to add a bit of excitement to your game night, consider using a poker timer [here's an example](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004H3XXG6/ref=asc_df_B004H3XXG6162778/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=311672381422&hvpos=1o4&hvnetw=g&hvrand=20960913198256959437&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqthre=&hvrestr=). This tool tells players when they need to make decisions and helps keep the game moving at a brisk pace.

Now that you know how to host the perfect poker night, it's time to put your skills into practice! Good luck!
