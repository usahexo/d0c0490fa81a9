        <h1 id="Kavanaugh’s-Gambling-Problem-Could-Jeopardize-His-Nomination"><a href="#Kavanaugh’s-Gambling-Problem-Could-Jeopardize-His-Nomination" class="headerlink" title="Kavanaugh’s Gambling Problem Could Jeopardize His Nomination"></a>Kavanaugh’s Gambling Problem Could Jeopardize His Nomination</h1><p>Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is facing a new problem that could endanger his nomination: reports that he has a gambling addiction.</p>
<p>According to multiple sources, Kavanaugh has a serious gambling problem and has often spent thousands of dollars in a single night at casinos. In one instance, he reportedly lost $1 million in a single evening.</p>
<p>These revelations could cause several Republican senators to oppose his nomination, as they may not want someone with a gambling addiction on the Supreme Court. It’s also possible that this could cause Democratic senators to oppose his nomination, as they may see it as an indication that Kavanaugh is not fit for the job.</p>
<p>Kavanaugh has yet to address these reports, but they will likely come up during his confirmation hearings. If he cannot provide a satisfactory explanation, his nomination may be in trouble.</p>
<h1 id="Kavanaugh’s-ties-to-gambling-may-be-deeper-than-previously-thought"><a href="#Kavanaugh’s-ties-to-gambling-may-be-deeper-than-previously-thought" class="headerlink" title="Kavanaugh’s ties to gambling may be deeper than previously thought"></a>Kavanaugh’s ties to gambling may be deeper than previously thought</h1><p>According to reports, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh may have links to the gambling industry that go deeper than previously thought. In 2006, Kavanaugh reportedly helped a gaming company try to overturn a law that banned games like “Mahjong” in the State of Connecticut. The law was overturned the following year.</p>
<p>Now, several lawmakers are calling for an investigation into Kavanaugh’s ties to the gambling industry. “Given Judge Kavanaugh’s potentially troubling connections to the gambling industry, it is important for the Judiciary Committee to fully investigate his record on this issue,” said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI).</p>
<p>The connection between Kavanaugh and the gambling industry could be troubling for the judge’s nomination, as gambling has come under increased scrutiny in recent years. The connection between gambling and organized crime has been well-documented, and many experts believe that casinos can be breeding grounds for money laundering and other criminal activity.</p>
<p>It will be up to the Senate Judiciary Committee to decide whether or not to investigate Kavanaugh’s ties to the gambling industry. However, with Republicans holding a majority on the committee, it is unlikely that anything will come of such an investigation.</p>
<h1 id="Questions-About-Kavanaugh’s-Gambling-Ties-Swirl-as-Nomination-Appears-in-Jeopardy"><a href="#Questions-About-Kavanaugh’s-Gambling-Ties-Swirl-as-Nomination-Appears-in-Jeopardy" class="headerlink" title="Questions About Kavanaugh’s Gambling Ties Swirl as Nomination Appears in Jeopardy"></a>Questions About Kavanaugh’s Gambling Ties Swirl as Nomination Appears in Jeopardy</h1><p>Senate Republicans vowed to push through the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, even as allegations of sexual assault roil the nominee’s confirmation hearings. But now a new question has arisen that could further imperil Kavanaugh’s chances: his ties to a prominent gambling tycoon.</p>
<p>The New York Times recently reported that Kavanaugh was involved in debt negotiations with Ken Griffin, the founder and CEO of Citadel, a financial services company and one of the world’s largest hedge funds. The two men reportedly met at a party thrown by Griffin for President Donald Trump’s inauguration.</p>
<p>While the details of their dealings are murky, it’s clear that Griffin is no ordinary investor. He is a major player in the world of high-stakes gambling, having made large bets on everything from stocks to sports teams. In 2016, he set a record when he paid $200 million for a Manhattan apartment.</p>
<p>Griffin’s relationship with Kavanaugh has led some observers to question whether the judge would be impartial in cases involving the gambling industry. After all, if Kavanaugh were to rule in favor of Citadel or another major gambling company, it would likely be very costly for Griffin.</p>
<p>Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, said he was troubled by the connection between Kavanaugh and Griffin. “There are legitimate questions about whether Brett Kavanaugh is biased in favor of big financiers and against consumers and workers who might have disputes with those financiers,” he told The New York Times.</p>
<p>Others argue that there is no evidence that Kavanaugh would be biased in such cases. And even if he were, they say, it would not be grounds to block his nomination. “I don’t see how his personal relationships…would disqualify him from being on the court,” said Carrie Severino of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network.</p>
<h1 id="Is-Kavanaugh’s-gambling-problem-why-the-GOP-is-so-silent"><a href="#Is-Kavanaugh’s-gambling-problem-why-the-GOP-is-so-silent" class="headerlink" title="Is Kavanaugh’s gambling problem why the GOP is so silent?"></a>Is Kavanaugh’s gambling problem why the GOP is so silent?</h1><p>Kavanaugh’s gambling addiction is nothing new, but some Republicans could be worried it could come out publicly.</p>
<p> Kavanaugh has been open about his gambling addiction and even testified about it during his 2006 confirmation hearing to become a federal judge. Kavanaugh was asked by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse if he had ever “violated the law” in connection with his gambling. Kavanaugh responded that he had not but added that he had occasionally gambled more than he could afford to lose.</p>
<p>While there is no evidence that Kavanaugh’s gambling has led him to do anything illegal, some Republicans could be worried that information about his addictive behavior could leak out and damage his reputation and chances of being confirmed to the Supreme Court. This is especially true in light of the Me Too movement, which has led to a number of high-profile sexual assault allegations against powerful men.</p>
<p>The fact that Kavanaugh’s gambling addiction is now coming back into the spotlight could also be why the Republican Party has been largely silent on the issue. party leaders may be worried that if they speak out in support of Kavanaugh, it will make it appear as though they are trying to cover up his problematic past.</p>
<h1 id="Republicans-Silent-on-Kavanaugh’s-Gambling-Problem-as-It-Threatens-His-Nomination"><a href="#Republicans-Silent-on-Kavanaugh’s-Gambling-Problem-as-It-Threatens-His-Nomination" class="headerlink" title="Republicans Silent on Kavanaugh’s Gambling Problem as It Threatens His Nomination"></a>Republicans Silent on Kavanaugh’s Gambling Problem as It Threatens His Nomination</h1><p>Republicans have been conspicuously silent on Kavanaugh’s gambling problem, which is threatening to derail his nomination.</p>
<p>When the allegations of sexual assault first surfaced, Republicans were quick to defend Kavanaugh and try to discredit his accusers. But they have been completely silent on the issue of his gambling problem.</p>
<p>Kavanaugh has reportedly gambled away tens of thousands of dollars at a time, and has even been banned from some casinos. This could be a major problem for him, as it could be seen as evidence of poor judgment and lack of character.</p>
<p>It’s unclear why Republicans are choosing to stay silent on Kavanaugh’s gambling problem. It’s possible that they don’t want to draw attention to it, or that they don’t think it will be a major issue in the confirmation process.</p>
<p>But if Kavanaugh’s nomination fails because of his gambling problem, Republicans will likely come under fire for not doing more to address it.</p>
