      Slot Machine Maker Plans to Hit Namibia

        <h1 id="Slot-Machine-Maker-Plans-to-Hit-Namibia"><a href="#Slot-Machine-Maker-Plans-to-Hit-Namibia" class="headerlink" title="Slot Machine Maker Plans to Hit Namibia"></a>Slot Machine Maker Plans to Hit Namibia</h1><p>Las Vegas-based slot machine maker International Game Technology PLC said it plans to start supplying its products to casinos in Namibia next year, becoming the latest international player to enter the southern African country’s gambling market.</p>
<p>The company said it had signed a deal with local gaming and entertainment company Casinos de Namibia to supply its machines to 12 of that country’s casinos from 2019.</p>
<p>IGT didn’t disclose how much it was investing in the venture but said it would create jobs in Namibia. It also said it hoped to capture a portion of the $1 billion in annual gaming revenue generated in Africa by 2020.</p>
<p>IGT is the second major international slot machine supplier to announce plans to enter the Namibian market this year after Swedish company NetEnt AB said in May that it had struck a deal with South African casino operator Sun International Ltd. to supply its products to its casinos there.</p>
<p>The moves come as Africa’s gambling sector grows, helped by increasing wealth and rising numbers of middle-class consumers. The continent is home to 1.2 billion people, about 40% of whom are below the age of 18, IGT said, citing research firm New World Wealth.</p>
<p>Africa’s gambling market was worth an estimated $14.5 billion in 2017 and is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 10.5% over the next decade, according to New World Wealth.</p>
<p>Namibia is one of Africa’s fastest-growing economies, with a GDP growth rate averaging around 5% over the past few years, thanks to mining and fisheries exports, among others sectors. IGT’s move into the country provides an interesting case study for how slot machine manufacturers assess market potential outside of their home markets - notably within countries that have growing economies and&#x2F;or populations</p>
<h1 id="Slot-Maker-Hits-Pay-Dirt-in-Namibia"><a href="#Slot-Maker-Hits-Pay-Dirt-in-Namibia" class="headerlink" title="Slot Maker Hits Pay Dirt in Namibia"></a>Slot Maker Hits Pay Dirt in Namibia</h1><p>slot maker, a leading name in the casino industry, has recently announced the successful opening of its new Namibian gaming venue. Reportedly drawing crowds from all over the country, the new slot parlor is located in Swakopmund and offers an array of exciting games and attractions.</p>
<p>Swakopmund is a popular tourist destination and the perfect spot for a gambling palace like slot maker’s new venue. Situated on the Atlantic coast, the town boasts stunning natural scenery and a bustling nightlife. In addition to slots and other casino games, the new Swakopmund casino offers table tennis, darts, pool, and a karaoke lounge.</p>
<p>Slot Maker CEO Ryan Waugh had this to say about the company’s latest venture: “We’re extremely proud of our new Namibian casino. It’s been a long time in the making, but it was worth the wait. The feedback we’ve been getting from players has been overwhelmingly positive.”</p>
<p>The new Swakopmund casino is part of Slot Maker’s aggressive expansion strategy. The company plans to open additional venues in Africa over the next few years, with a focus on countries that have burgeoning gambling markets.</p>
<h1 id="Slot-Maker’s-Winning-Streak-Continues-in-Namibia"><a href="#Slot-Maker’s-Winning-Streak-Continues-in-Namibia" class="headerlink" title="Slot Maker’s Winning Streak Continues in Namibia"></a>Slot Maker’s Winning Streak Continues in Namibia</h1><p>Slot Maker, a leading manufacturer of slot machines, enjoyed another successful outing at the Africa Gaming Expo (AGE) 2017 in Namibia. The company’s products were on prominent display at the event, and drew great interest from casino operators and other industry players.</p>
<p>Slot Maker’s latest offering, the Crystal Triple Play machine, was a big hit at the show. This innovative product offers players the excitement of three games in one: slots, blackjack, and roulette. It proved to be extremely popular with attendees, who were drawn to its impressive graphics and gameplay.</p>
<p>In addition to the Crystal Triple Play machine, Slot Maker also showcased its other popular products, including the Crystal Single Play and Crystal Double Play slot machines. These machines are designed for players who want to experience all the excitement of online slots without spending too much time or money.</p>
<p> Slot Maker’s success at AGE 2017 is just the latest in a long string of victories for the company. Its products have been met with rave reviews from casino operators and gamers alike, and its strong track record has helped it become a leading player in the global gaming market.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Slot Maker is poised for continued success in the years to come. With its innovative products and strong commitment to customer satisfaction, the company is well positioned to take advantage of emerging opportunities in the global gaming market.</p>
<h1 id="Slot-Machine-Maker-Hits-Big-in-Namibia"><a href="#Slot-Machine-Maker-Hits-Big-in-Namibia" class="headerlink" title="Slot Machine Maker Hits Big in Namibia"></a>Slot Machine Maker Hits Big in Namibia</h1><p>Slot machines are one of the most popular casino games in the world, and players can now enjoy them in Namibia. Slot maker Jadestone has announced that it has partnered with local casino operator Safari Park to bring its games to the African country.</p>
<p>Jadestone CEO Mikael Hansson says that the company is excited to be bringing its games to Africa. “Africa is a new and exciting market for us, and we are thrilled to be working with Safari Park,” he says.</p>
<p>The partnership will see Jadestone’s slot machines installed at six of Safari Park’s properties across the country. Players will be able to enjoy a range of games, including the popular Thunderstorm and Diamond Strike titles.</p>
<p>“We are confident that our partnership with Jadestone will add value to our guests’ gaming experience,” says Safari Park CEO Lutz Heusinger. “Their slots are well known for their high quality and innovative gameplay, which our guests will appreciate.”</p>
<p>Safari Park is one of Africa’s largest casino operators, and the company is bullish about the potential for gambling in Namibia. “The market potential for gambling in Namibia is significant,” Heusinger says. “Jadestone’s games are sure to be well received by our guests.”</p>
<h1 id="Slot-Maker’s-Seamless-Execution-Nets-Him-Big-Wins-in-Namibia"><a href="#Slot-Maker’s-Seamless-Execution-Nets-Him-Big-Wins-in-Namibia" class="headerlink" title="Slot Maker’s Seamless Execution Nets Him Big Wins in Namibia"></a>Slot Maker’s Seamless Execution Nets Him Big Wins in Namibia</h1><p>Slot Maker was one of the early developers of online casino software and has been in the business since 1997. With a long history in the industry, Slot Maker has a wealth of experience in creating gaming products that are not only seamless and bug-free but also provide an enjoyable experience for players.</p>
<p>This was never more evident than when Slot Maker secured a contract to provide its software to a new casino in Namibia. The casino went online in March 2017 and has been a big hit with players thanks to the high quality of Slot Maker’s gaming products. In particular, the Namibian casino’s slot games have proved hugely popular, thanks to their intuitive gameplay and engaging graphics.</p>
<p>Slot Maker is rightly proud of its track record in Namibia, where its products have helped the casino achieve impressive levels of success. In less than six months, the casino has welcomed over 160,000 players and generated over $1 million in revenue. This is testament not only to Slot Maker’s world-class software but also to the hard work and dedication of the casino’s team.</p>
